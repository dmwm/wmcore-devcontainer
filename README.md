# WMCore Development Containers

Scripts and configuration to develop in WMCore containers

## Requirements
* `docker`, `docker compose` plugin
* Access to CERN registry

## Usage

```bash
# Enter WMCore code directory
cd <wmcore code directory>

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/dmwm/wmcore-development .devcontainer`

# cd to your container area
cd .devcontainer

# Copy `env-template` to `.env` and
# modify CERT_DIR, WMCORE_CODE_DIR
cp env-template .env

# optionally: adjust your .env file if necessary

# Log into registry
docker login registry.cern.ch

# Start containers
docker compose up -d wmcore-dev

# Enter wmcore-dev container
docker compose exec -it wmcore-dev /bin/bash

# now you should get prompt within docker image where you should cd to /workspaces/WMCore
[root@docker-desktop cmsbld]# cd /workspaces/WMCore

# Source unit test environment
source .devcontainer/env_unittest.sh

# Stop all containers
docker compose down

# Updating or adding dependencies
pip install <dependency>

# Stopping containers
# In the devcontainer directory
docker compose down
```

## Configuration
Environment variables used in the `docker-compose.yaml` file must be defined in a `.env` file located in the same directory as the compose file.

### Certificates
Currently, the certificates and keys are located in `$CERT_DIR/usercert.pem` and `$CERT_DIR/userkey_nopwd.pem`. This was created following instructions here: https://cms-wmcore.docs.cern.ch/development/setup-wmcore-unittest/#5-authenticate-yourself-when-running-unittests

```
openssl pkcs12 -in ~/certs-mount/myCertificate.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out ~/certs/usercert.pem`
openssl pkcs12 -in ~/certs-mount/myCertificate.p12 -nocerts -out ~/certs/userkey.pem
chmod 400 ~/certs/userkey.pem
openssl rsa -in ~/certs/userkey.pem -out ~/certs/userkey_nopwd.pem
```

## Integration with VSCode
This repository also contains a `devcontainer.json` configuration file for integration with VSCode. This can be pretty opinionated, such as adding tools a developer may use normally. In this case, forking this repo is suggested.

1. Clone this repo in `WMCore/.devcontainer`. This repo must be located under `WMCore/.devcontainer`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmwm/wmcore-development .devcontainer
```

2. Open `WMCore` in VSCode.
3. Reopen the repository in a container.

## Caveats
On macOS, since Docker/Podman containers are run in a virtual machine, bind mounts may be slow. Future developments can consider cloning the dmwm/WMCore repository in a named volume, or a container volume
